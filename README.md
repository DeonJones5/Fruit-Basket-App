# Fruit-Basket-App
This application is designed around a CSV file, which contains a list of Fruits, the name, the age of the fruit in the store, and two characteristics of the fruit. You will be able to see the count of how many fruit is in the list, the amount of fruit types, and how old each individual fruit type is. 

I) Build
mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip
This command will generate fruit-basket.jar in target folder

(I have already created this and copied to the Catalog folder)

II) Run Application from command line
java -jar fruit-basket.jar basket.csv
